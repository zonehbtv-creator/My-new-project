Final project for the Laser Hologram For Event Hall Decoration

## Summary

My ideal innovation (idea) will SOLVE the problem of using physical decoration materials (brick and mortar) to beautify event hall in preparation for an event.


## Background

Digitalizing event hall decorations. it's innovation vs brick and mortal approach. Just bringing a projector and wow up the place with digital hologram creativity. We are in a technology age where AI is taking over.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

The device (projector) will be powered by rechargable battries. Event centers (halls). weddings, birthdays, corporate and social gathering inside a hall. Event planners, decorators.



## Data sources and AI methods
It will be generated by Chatgpt

## Challenges

Non to think of for now. its still in gestation (idea) period.

## What next?

It will be monitored to see where needs improvement and where needs to be modified.


## Acknowledgments

Aside from my raw idea, i'll also inculcate 13in 1 planetarium Meteor Projection Light, USB light. Party light, DJ sound activated disco light
